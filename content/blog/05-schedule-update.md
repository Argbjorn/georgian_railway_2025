title: "Major Schedule Update"
date: 2025-03-26

Today I managed to update and supplement the schedule for all active routes. Recently, stations and arrival times for almost all trains appeared on the [GR test site](https://gr.com.ge/en), so I transferred them here before they disappear or break again.

Most of the data looks good, but there are a few suspicious points. The numbering of electric trains between Khashuri and Zestafoni does not match the numbering on the official website. I made a note to check this when possible. Also, on the train route between Kutaisi and Sachkhere, which was restarted yesterday after a winter break, there seem to be fewer stations than there should be (I rode it once and had the impression that we were stopping at every house along the way).

Overall, the schedule has become much better, almost perfect. I really hope that GR will update the test site in sync with the main one and we won't have to label routes with "Incomplete data" badges anymore, as was the case for half of the routes just yesterday.
