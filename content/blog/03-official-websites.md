title: Official websites of Georgian Railway

Georgian Railway's online presence is quite complicated. There are two official websites, and to get the full picture, you need to visit both of them. This is one of the reasons why [georailway.com](https://georailway.com) was created. Here, I'll briefly describe what each site offers.

## https://www.railway.ge/
This is the main Georgian Railway website. The homepage is filled with images and outdated news, so the really useful information is buried deeper, making it unclear at first glance. The most relevant section is here: [https://www.railway.ge/en/passenger-traffic/](https://www.railway.ge/en/passenger-traffic/). This page contains the current, albeit brief, [schedule](https://www.railway.ge/en/traffic-general-schedule/), contacts, and regulations.

There is also a fair amount of outdated information. For example, the "Train running schedule (Gares)" page features old PDFs with Stadler train timetables, while the "Regional trains" section has a train search form that only finds Stadler services.

## https://gr.com.ge/en
A new Georgian Railway website currently in test mode. Despite this, tickets that can be purchased online (express trains between Batumi and Tbilisi, 853/854 Ozurgeti-Tbilisi-Ozurgeti, 869/870 Zugdidi-Tbilisi-Zugdidi, 873/874 Poti-Tbilisi-Poti) can be purchased here. Other information, especially the schedule, should be treated with caution until the test phase is over. The timetable here is more detailed, showing stops, but the train list is inaccurate, with extra and missing routes, as well as incorrect times for some trains.

## Bonus: https://www.facebook.com/GeoRailway/
Georgian Railway's Facebook page. The only place with up-to-date news. For example, train cancellations and new routes are posted here promptly. Other social media accounts of Georgian Railway are useless in this regard.

All this information is accurate as of April 15, 2025. I'll update it as needed.
